Topics for discussion included making effective use of the [Graal
compiler](https://github.com/oracle/graal), performance evaluations and
opportunities with Graal on benchmarks and applications, developing new
features and optimizations in Graal, creative and novel uses of the Graal
infrastructure and growing the Graal CE open source community.



## Program 
    9:00 AM - Welcome

    9:15 AM - Keynote:  Tom Rodriguez (Oracle Labs)
              Title:    Graal as a native JIT in GraalVM
              Abstract: This talk will discuss the design and implementation of libgraal, the
                        Graal and Truffle JIT compiled into a static library using Native Image
                        that is used as the default JIT in GraalVM. It will describe the
                        challenges of interfacing libgraal with HotSpot, the way native
                        compilation mode differs from the pure Java compilation mode and the
                        various ways Substrate technologies are used within the library itself.
              Bio:      Tom Rodriguez started worked on the JDK around 1.1 and worked on HotSpot
                        starting in 1.4, primarily on the client and server compilers.  For the
                        last six years he's been a member of the Graal compiler team and was the
                        primary implementor of libgraal.

    10:15 AM - How to statically compile a serverless application to survive the biggest bursty e-commerce data traffic
